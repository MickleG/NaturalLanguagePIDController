create_dataset.py is used to create a dataset named PID_dataset.txt which the model trains on. Please run this first.
main.py is used to run the entire script. Training can be specified, parameters of each classifier can be altered, and full_testing = True runs the robot arm simulation on the model paths that are saved to the parent directory
